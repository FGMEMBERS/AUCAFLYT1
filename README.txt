Hi,

We would like to thank you for downloading our Aucafly T1.  This is without a doubt an aircraft for motorists with unique taste. 

AUCAFLY T1 is licensed under GPL, and its FDM and sound files are from D-Echoâ€™s X2 (propeller aircraft), airspeed indicator from Joshua Davidson's MD-90 (Based off Joshua Davidson's MD-88, which is based on Gary Neely's MD-81).

Please visit our website and download our sound add-on folder.

If you believe that our aircraft has an error, you should inform us by visiting our website.  

We hope you enjoy our aircraft and we are looking forward to seeing snapshots and videos of your flights in the FG forum, Youtube and social media sites.

Best regards,

Aucafly Team
